make it so check for genbank cache is done seperately for sequence and taxonomy so that only hte taxonomhy is downloaded if that is missing. 

Check what low complexity filtering I use with Blast

Use new-style classes everywhere

Update SAP with the code from stuffer - both machinepool, sge, and the multicpu parts

Calculate the proportion of stem to crown assignemts. 

use the _isLief() function instead of doing self.count == 0 or len(self.dict) ... 

Make a function _insertPlaceHolderLevel()

New interface for assignment that fits IM too

Make sure infinite distances are handled sensitbly in ConstraindNJ 

Defualt values are not show in lists in options in gui 

Remove cnexus.so from svn 

Is is possible at all to get the problem that we delete the lowest taxonomic level with highest prob. when collapsing levels with placeHolders? 

Add a baseProb to each pruneList entry so that _print of each pruned trees can be called with the correct top baseProb

Find this and take a look at it: #print "inserting placeholder child at level WHY IS DBID SOMETIMES NONE?", level, key, self.dict[key].dbid 

Make sure __iadd__ in TaxonomySummary supports dibids. 

Add changes to Consolescripts to GUI also. 

Figure out a way to keep the original names of the local database sequences (and genbank ones too) for showing in the alignments. 

figure out a way to make sapdb databases portable. Also why is one of the files called *.db.db? 

Sort out what to do with the now different functionality in the python version of ConstrainedNJ: That it takes a matrix and that it returns a treestring with labels on each node.

Make threads killable using KillableThread

Implement fix at line 296 in Homology.py

TreeStatistics line 815: 

Add warning when users use more the 50 homologs with the MCMC version.

The treestats files should have a plugin specific suffix like the tree files, so we do not loose that information if we run another assignment plugin. 

Make a list of SAP database errors and warning messages

See if I avoid environmental and uncultured sequences from GenBank.

Use new-style classes everywhere.

Implement the --scrictlylocal or --offline option to keep native from getting taxonomies from NCBI if the information is wrongly formatted.

There should be a warnings pickle file with a dict like this: warnings[<query_name>] = ['warning....', 'warning....', 'warning....'] that is loaded in each analysis stage so warning can be recorded for each query and then printed on the results clone page. 

Run longrunning c/c++ extensions in parallel thread and subclass KeyboardInterrupt so that it makes a system call to "kill -p " + os.getpid()

Write code so that all sequences above some cutoff are writen to a fasta file.

Make the seperately usefull parts of SAP into its packages under SVN control

Make download of taxonomy use eutils

Change interface standard for SearchResult

Implement Genbank retrieval the same way as I did in for IMa
